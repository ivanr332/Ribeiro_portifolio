# From Curiosity to Insight

It all started with a question:  
**"What if I could use data to understand how the world works â€” and make it better?"**

Growing up in Brazil, I was always curious about patterns â€” whether in school grades, family budgets, or soccer stats. That curiosity became a passion as I discovered the world of data science.

## My Journey So Far

After working as a Business Analyst, I moved to the U.S. to deepen my knowledge. Iâ€™m currently studying Business Analytics and developing skills in:

- **Power BI & SQL** â€“ for building dashboards that tell clear, actionable stories  
- **Python & Pandas** â€“ to analyze, clean, and model data  
- **Machine Learning** â€“ to make predictions and uncover trends  
- **Data Visualization** â€“ to turn numbers into insights people can understand

Iâ€™ve worked on real projects that reduced reporting time, improved decision-making, and supported teams across departments.

## Why This Portfolio?

This site is more than a list of projects â€” it's a record of how I think, learn, and solve problems.

Each section reflects part of my story:  
- The **questions** I asked  
- The **methods** I used  
- The **lessons** I learned  
- The **value** I delivered  

You can explore some of the tools I use and the stories behind the data in the sections to come.

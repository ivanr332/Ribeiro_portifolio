# A Journey from Curiosity to Code

As a kid, I was always fascinated by patterns how numbers added up, how systems worked, and how decisions were made. Years later, that same curiosity led me into the world of **data science**, where those patterns could shape real-world outcomes.

Today, Iâ€™m a Business Analytics student with hands-on experience in:
- Data visualization
- Predictive modeling
- SQL automation
- Power BI dashboards

## What Drives Me

I believe in the power of data to:
- Tell stories that matter  
- Empower better decisions  
- Solve problems at scale  

Each project I take on is not just about crunching numbers it's about discovering insights that can make a real difference.
